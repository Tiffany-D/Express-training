# Express-training

Started to get familiar with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/fr/) which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications. Following are some of the core features of Express framework:

    - Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.

    - Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.

    - Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates



  I followed [this YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q8rUGCN9k).

  I only set the routes in the same file but there's another way of doing it, separate them in different files and using the 'router' in the main file of the Express app.

  Middleware is basically a function that will receive the Request and Response objects, just like your route Handlers do. As a third argument you have another function which you should call once your middleware code completed.
